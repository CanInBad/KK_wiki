# KoboldKare wiki conversion

This repo still need a lot of work before its acceptable to release. but there is a section that is done  
They are:
 - [Modding](./modding/Modding)

the license is inherited from wiki, which is **CC BY-SA 3.0**, but I don't know if this is actually the one found in the wiki or not, the dump did not have any legal information on it and when asking the wiki owner, he answered it is CC BY-SA 3.0

directory `notdone` is as suggested, not done  
directory `done` is as suggested, done  
They will all move to root once all of them are done
