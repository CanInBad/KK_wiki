## Supplies

- **Egg:** Can be purchased from *[Macromart](Locations#Town)* for $5 or laid after metabolizing Cum or Love. Purchased eggs have 20 units of scrambled eggs in them and eggs Kobolds laid have a minimum of 25 units.
- **Melon:** Can be found in *[The Forest](Locations#Forests)* or grown on your farm from seeds ($15). When you grind them you get pink Melon Juice which causes breast grow.
- **Eggplant:** Can be found in *[The Forest](Locations#Forests)* or grown on your farm from seeds ($10). When you grind them you get purple Eggplant Juice which causes penis growth.
- **Pineapple:** Can be found in *[The Forest](Locations#Forests)* or grown on your farm from seeds (\$10). When you grind them you get yellow Pineapple Juice which causes ball growth.
- **Mushroom:** They can be found in *[The Caves](Locations#Cave)*. When you grind them you get pink Mushroom Juice which makes Kobolds shrink and lose saturation.
- **Wheat:** Can only be grown on your farm from seeds (\$10). Becomes flour when ground.
- **Banana:** Can only be found in *[The Forest](Locations#Forests)*. Becomes Potassium when ground.
- **Heart:** Hearts act as cum for Kobolds without a dick and will spawn upon climax. 10 units of Love is added to the Heart if they or another Kobold without a dick cum again near it. (on Love.) The genetic material in the Heart is set to who ever came near it last.
- **Ice:** Can be bought from the *[Tool Store](Locations#Town)* for \$20. Used in recipes.
- **Seeds:** Bought at *[Macromart](Locations#Town)* in town. Used for [Farming](Farming). One seed packet will yield 2 - 3 fruits.

See [Liquids](Items#Liquids) for more details and recipes.

## Tools

- **Bucket:** Buckets can be filled with all sorts of [Liquids](#Liquids). Use the Bucket by holding it with right-click, and then shooting with left-click to feed the Kobolds.  
  Buckets can be purchased at the *[Macromart](Locations)* in town for \$15. Contains 20 units of liquid.

- **Watering can:** Watering cans can be filled with all sorts of [Liquids](#Liquids). Use the Watering can by holding it with right-click, and then shooting with left-click to feed the Kobolds.  
  Watering Cans can be purchased at the *[Tool Store](Locations)* in town for \$50. Contains 30 units of liquid.

- **Trough:** Troughs can be filled with all sorts of [Liquids](#Liquids). Use the trough by holding it with right-click, and then shooting with left-click to feed the Kobolds.  
  Troughs can be purchased at the *[Tool Store](Locations)* in town for \$25. Contains 60 units of liquid.

- **Dildos:** These are used to show your Kobolds just how much you love them. If used on a Kobold long enough they will spawn a heart or cum.  
  Can be purchased at the *[Pawnshop](Locations)* for \$50 each. Currently they are only available in a standard XL size. Throwing any [Liquids](#Liquids) on them increases their size.

- **Bomb:** Bombs are used to clear the farm plots from rocks. To explode a Bomb, look for the <img src="../images/items/BombActivate.png" alt="BOMB ACTIVATE!!!!" width="5%"/> symbol and use it to activate. Since they are potassium explosions, they can be ground in the grinder for their potassium. They are available for purchase at the *[Pawnshop](Locations)* for \$200.

- **Scanner:** The Scanner is used to measure the contents of many items, including but not limited to:  
  - Kobolds
  - buckets
  - watering cans
  - Troughs
  - What is left in the grinder
  - What is left inside the seed extractor
  - What is inside a kobold (Both what make up a kobold and what had yet to be metabolized, currently there is no separation)
  - Units in melons, eggplants, love, eggs, and more.

  The scanner can be purchased from the *[Tool Store](Locations)* for \$25.

### Liquid Notes

- All liquids increase belly size when ingested. Most of which will get metabolized out. The exceptions are Eggs, Yogurt after metabolizing 20 units, and body altering juice that after the Metabolism bar is full (Pie and Pineapple Popsicle excluded).
- Metabolizing liquids that give energy while the energy bar is full increases fat. Fat can be lost from using up your energy multiple times.
- Eggplant and Pineapple juice increase still genetically increase stats even if the Kobold doesn't have a penis or balls. Their offspring can still inherit these genes.
- Things sprayed into the grinder are re-dispensed, Including rain water.
- Grinding multiple compatible reagents in the grinder will combine them.
- The tub can be used to mix liquids, but be warned: pulling the drain plug will drain all current contents.
- No juice is produced from grinding:
  - The scanner
  - Empty Containers
- As of 2/10/2021, Kobolds cannot be ground in the grinder.
  - As Kobolds are no longer able to be gibbed, they are not vulnerable to explosions. Spraying them with water and potassium allows them to become one time explosives, able to efficiently clear the field of rocks.
- Any liquid can be used to "water" eggs and grounded kobolds, as well as plants.
- The Watering Can's model doesn't change if it holds a model transforming liquid.
  - Makes collecting Cum from *[Breeding Mounts](Farm_Upgrade#Breeding_Mount)* much easier.
