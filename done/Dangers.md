## Dangers and death

Eventually, there will be enemies in the world.  
Currently, there are no enemys :\(  
However there are other dangers to keep in mind.

- **The void**: Being out of bounds (too low) causes death. The void extends up and horizontally, but if you go to far below map level, death awaits you.

*Note: Kobolds can no longer be gibbed in the grinder.*
