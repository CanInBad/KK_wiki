around the map. These propel the player and/or items towards a set

destination. the jump pad can be bought for 80 dollars at the builder's

shop, they are located at your farm and in town.

The lake is in the middle of the map. While Kobolds can neither swim nor

drown, there is also fish that give meat when interacted with.



  

*Inflator*: There are 3 sections to the machine. When facing head on,

the left is where you put a kobold you want to inflate. The button is

for injecting stored liquid from the tank on the right. The tank can

store 120 unit. On the right should be breeding mount (not included with

the machine but included as breed mount upgrade from kitchen).

  breeding mount by extension).
