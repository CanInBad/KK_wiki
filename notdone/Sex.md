*Yes, that is right. In a smut game, there is sex.* <strong>If this
offends you, please leave now.</strong>

## Sex animations

Besides vanilla, impromptu sex, there are a few sex animation settings.

### What determines who goes into which role?

The primary deciding factor is who's got the dingus, the secondary
factor would be size and distance.

Closer kobolds get higher priority for the first animation station
(which varies on if it's penetrative or not, though it's consistent on
consecutive tries)

### Sex behaviors

![](GroupActivity.png "GroupActivity.png") These scenes can be entered
when you and another kobold are around, by pressing the use key on the
symbol pictured here. They can run indefinitely, there is no automatic
exit condition. You can exit willingly by jumping or death. Some require
certain sizes.

Animations are physics based, and so there is a little 'mating dance'
before each animation to align the *bits*

You can have two kobolds attempt these animations if you drag and
release them near one. You can pull them out of the animation by
grabbing them again.

<i>While it does work at a variety of sizes: significant size
differences, a pair of tiny kobolds, or a pair of very large kobolds may
create unintended animation interactions. Growing while in a animation
does not cancel the animation.</i>
