## Specific Game behaviors

There are some special traits to this game right now

### Size

- Any particular asset can only be up to 10x the starting size
- Growth is logarithmic: Growth is more dramatic at the beginning and
  slows down the bigger the asset.
- A combination of 2000 units of reagent, or ~100 fruits, will max out
  your size stat.

#### Magnum Dong

- Gigantic dongs sometimes make kobolds unapproachable/unmovable without
  being speared.
- All sizes of kobold are subject to a good dicking. They are flexible
  to no end.

#### Multiplayer

- Multiplayer player sync is not perfect.
  - Ragdolls are never exactly aligned
  - Dick position is not exactly aligned. Traditionally becomes bigger
    of a problem with a bigger dick.
  - Flasks can desync when attached to a nipple, either because you see
    the flask attached to your nipple or others see it on yours but not
    both.
  - Items have ownership, so when someone leaves or quits, the items
    they 'owned' disappear with them. This is particularly noticeable
    when the player who started a server leaves, because at that point
    the majority if not all items and noc kobolds will de-spawn,
    including unpurchased items.
