Downloading and editing KoboldKare is a technical process, if you simply want to download and play the game you do not need to do this!

## Prerequisites

First you'll need the following:

1.  [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
2.  [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
3.  [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)



You can download them all via [Windows package manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#use-winget), and this is recommended as both Blender and git need to show up within your system path.

## Installing KoboldKare SDK
    
1.  Clone the [KoboldKare repository](https://github.com/naelstrof/KoboldKare). This can be done with git, or your favorite git management software like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you're unfamiliar with commandline, I highly recommend you install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage the repository.
2.  Download the KoboldKare's version of Unity using *Unity Hub*. Unity Hub will do this automatically as you try to open the project. Otherwise as of this commit it is *2021.3.19f1*, which you can download by putting this link in a browser:  
    `unityhub://2021.3.19f1/c9714fde33b6`
3.  Finally open the project by pointing Unity Hub at the KoboldKare folder, if blender and git are properly installed it should open normally after a long import.
